Hi Alice,

I hope this message finds you well! I just came across your work at Acme Inc, and I wanted to take a moment to compliment you on the next-gen fintech tools youâ€™re building. Itâ€™s clear you have a vision that could really reshape the industry!

I wanted to share a resource that might be beneficial for you as you navigate your journey. Thereâ€™s a permissionless fundraising platform designed specifically for under-the-radar builders like yourself. It could be a great way to connect with investors who are eager to support innovative projects.

Iâ€™d love to connect and learn more about your vision for Acme Inc. Letâ€™s chat if youâ€™re interested!

Best,
